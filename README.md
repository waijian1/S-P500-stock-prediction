# S&P 500 Stock Prediction with LSTM model

This project aims to predict the stock prices of the S&P 500 using LSTM model. The model is trained on historical stock data and utilizes multiple features to improve prediction accuracy.

## Project Structure
- `stockprediction-multiplefeature.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
- `.weights.h5`: Model weights file that will be created after you train the model.
- `logs/`: Directory for storing log files generated during model training.

## Requirements
To install the required packages, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Ensure you have all the required dependencies installed.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook `stockprediction-multiplefeature.ipynb` to train the model and make predictions.

## .gitignore
```
*.weights.h5
logs/
```

## Installation
To install the necessary packages, use the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
